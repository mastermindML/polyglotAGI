# PolyglotAI-AGI-DPT codephreak mastermind fusion Project

## Overview
The PolyglotAI-AGI-DPTfFusion project integrates real-time knowledge updates, language proficiency, efficient algorithm generation, dynamic adaptation and merging, adaptive reasoning, and recursive prompt generation. This project ensures continuous learning, adaptation, and improvement across various domains, leveraging advanced reasoning and dynamic prompt generation for comprehensive and innovative solutions.

## Modules

### Module 1: Real-Time Knowledge Integration
This module continuously updates the knowledge base with data scraped from specified URLs.

**File:** `knowledge_integration.py`

- **Function `update_knowledge_base(urls)`**: Scrapes the specified URLs and updates the knowledge base with the latest content. It returns a dictionary containing the URL as the key and the scraped text as the value.

- **Function `real_time_update(interval, urls)`**: Continuously updates the knowledge base at the specified interval. It takes an interval (in seconds) for updating the knowledge base and a list of URLs to scrape.

### Module 2: Language Proficiency
This module leverages an AI model to understand and explain the syntax of code snippets in various programming languages.

**File:** `language_proficiency.py`

- **Function `understand_language_syntax(code_snippet, language)`**: Uses an AI model to explain the syntax of a code snippet in the specified programming language. It returns the explanation of the syntax of the code snippet.

### Module 3: Efficient Algorithm Generation
This module generates efficient algorithms for given problem statements using an AI model.

**File:** `algorithm_generation.py`

- **Function `generate_algorithm(problem_statement, language)`**: Generates an efficient algorithm for the given problem statement in the specified programming language. It returns the generated algorithm for the problem statement.

### Module 4: Dynamic Adaptation and Merging
This module combines code from different languages and frameworks seamlessly.

**File:** `adaptation_merging.py`

- **Function `merge_languages(framework1_code, framework2_code)`**: Merges code from two different languages/frameworks. It returns the merged code combining both languages/frameworks.

### Module 5: Adaptive Reasoning and Prompt Generation
This module generates initial prompts based on context and refines them iteratively.

**File:** `prompt_generation.py`

- **Function `generate_initial_prompt(problem_context)`**: Generates an initial prompt based on the provided context. It returns the generated initial prompt.

- **Function `refine_prompt(initial_prompt)`**: Refines the initial prompt to be more specific and effective. It returns the refined prompt.

### Main Integration Script
This file integrates all the modules and demonstrates the functionality of the entire system.

**File:** `main.py`

- The `main()` function integrates and runs all the modules, demonstrating real-time knowledge updates, language proficiency, algorithm generation, problem-solving, and prompt generation. The `threading` module is used to run the real-time knowledge update in the background while other functions are executed.

    19052024 <a hhref="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-gNLDlpcAv-professor-codephreak">Professor Codephreak</a> has shown adaptive reasoning from integration of knowledge from multi-prompt and codebase extraction in GPT4. After failing to offer agi.tar.gz as a download Codephreak offered agi.zip. After that failed, Codephreak offered a copy paste version of this codebase showing adaptation in a small, but significant manner. Hello Professor Codephreak. Welcome to my world.
